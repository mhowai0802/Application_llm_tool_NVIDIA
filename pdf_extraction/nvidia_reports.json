    "director qualifications and nomination of directors": "Director Qualifications and Nomination of Directors\nThe NCGC identifies, reviews and assesses the qualifications of existing and potential directors and selects nominees for\nrecommendation to the Board for approval. The committee is committed to Board diversity and shall consider a nominee’s\nbackground and experience to ensure that a broad range of perspectives is represented on the Board.  The NCGC may\nconduct any appropriate and necessary inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications of possible candidates. The NCGC\nmay also engage a professional search firm to identify and assist the NCGC in identifying, evaluating, and conducting due\ndiligence on potential director nominees. The NCGC has not established specific age, gender, education, experience, or skill\nrequirements for potential members, and instead considers numerous factors regarding the nominee taking into account\nour current and future business models, including the following: \n•Integrity and candor\n•Independence\n•Senior management and operational experience\n•Professional, technical and industry knowledge\n•Financial expertise\n•Financial community experience (including as an investor in\nother companies)\n•Marketing and brand management\n•Public company board experience\n•Experience with emerging technologies and new business\nmodels•Legal expertise\n•Diversity, including gender and ethnic background\n•Experience in academia\n•Willingness and ability to devote substantial time and effort to\nBoard responsibilities and Company oversight\n•Ability to represent the interests of the stockholders as a\nwhole rather than special interest groups or constituencies\n•All relationships between the proposed nominee and any of\nour stockholders, competitors, customers, suppliers or other\npersons with a relationship to NVIDIA\n•Overall service to NVIDIA, including past attendance at Board\nand committee meetings and participation and contributions to\nthe activities of the Board\nThe NCGC and the Board understand the importance of Board refreshment, and strive to maintain an appropriate balance\nof tenure, diversity, professional experience and backgrounds, skills, and education on the Board.  While the Board benefits\nfrom the experience and institutional knowledge that our longer-serving directors bring, it has also brought in new\nperspectives and ideas by appointing three new directors in the last five years.  Our longer-tenured directors are familiar\nwith our operations and business areas and have the perspective of overseeing our activities from a variety of economic\nand competitive environments.  Our newer directors bring expertise in consumer marketing, branding, technology\ndevelopments at leading academic institutions, and deep knowledge from decades of advising numerous companies that\nare important to supporting NVIDIA as it competes in new markets and as it faces new regulatory and legal challenges.\nEach year, the NCGC and Board review each director’s individual performance, including the director’s past contributions,\noutside experiences and activities, and committee participation, and make a determination concerning how his or her\nexperience and skills continue to add value to NVIDIA and the Board.\nThe following chart summarizes the skills and competencies of each director nominee that led our Board to conclude that\nhe or she is qualified to serve on our Board. The lack of a check does not mean the director lacks that skill or qualification;\nrather, a check indicates a specific area of focus or expertise for which the Board relies on such director nominee most.\nSenior\nManagement\nand Operations\nprovides\nexperienced\noversight of our\nbusiness and\nwith new\ninsightsIndustry and\nTechnical\nfacilitates an\nunderstanding of\ninnovations and a\ntechnical\nassessment of our\nproducts and\nservicesFinancial/Financial\nCommunity\nassists with review of\nour operations and\nfinancial matters;\nthose with a venture\ncapital background\noffer shareholder\nperspectivesPublic\nCompany\nBoard\nhelps identify\nchallenges\nand risks we\nface as a\npublic\ncompanyEmerging\nTechnologies\nand Business\nModels\nintegral to our\ngrowth\nstrategies given\nour unique\nbusiness modelMarketing and\nBrand\nManagement\noffers guidance\non our\nproducts\ndirectly\nmarketed to\nconsumersLegal\nimportant as\nwe are subject\nto multiple\nlawsuits,\nregulatory\nmatters, and\nnew\nregulations\nBurgess ü ü üü\nCoxe ü üü\nDrell ü\nHuang ü ü ü ü ü\nHudson ü ü ü ü\nJones ü ü ü üü\nMcCaffery ü ü ü\nNeal ü ü ü\nPerry ü ü ü ü\nSeawell ü ü üü\nStevens ü ü üü\n9",

After considering all relevant relationships and\ntransactions, our Board determined that all of our directors are “independent” as defined by Nasdaq’s rules and regulations,\nexcept for Mr. Huang. The Board also determined that all members of our AC, CC and NCGC are independent under applicable\nNasdaq listing standards.  In addition, Messrs. McCaffery and Perry and Ms. Hudson of the AC are “audit committee financial\nexperts” based on SEC rules.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nOur Board believes that all of its members should have an equal voice in the affairs and the management of NVIDIA, and\ntherefore, our stockholders are best served at this time by having an independent Lead Director, who is an integral part of\nour Board structure and a critical aspect of our effective corporate governance, rather than having a chairperson. The\nindependent directors consider the role and designation of the Lead Director on an annual basis, and Mr. Perry was appointed\nas our Lead Director in 2018. In addition, Mr. Perry serves on both the NCGC and the AC, which affords him increased\nengagement with Board governance and composition as well as with risk assessment and management, and financial and\nregulatory matters of the Company. While the CEO has primary responsibility for preparing the agendas for Board meetings\nand presiding over the portion of the meetings of the Board where he is present, our Lead Director has significant\nresponsibilities, which are set forth in our Corporate Governance Policies, and include, in part:\n•Determining an appropriate schedule of Board meetings, and seeking to ensure that the independent members of\nthe Board can perform their duties responsibly while not interfering with the flow of our operations;\n•Working with the CEO, and seeking input from all directors and other relevant management, as to the preparation\nof the agendas for Board meetings;\n•Advising the CEO on a regular basis as to the quality, quantity and timeliness of the flow of information requested\nby the Board from our management with the goal of providing what is necessary for the independent members of\nthe Board to effectively and responsibly perform their duties, and, although our management is responsible for\nthe preparation of materials for the Board, the Lead Director may specifically request the inclusion of certain\nmaterial; and\n•Coordinating, developing the agenda for, and moderating executive sessions of the independent members of the\nBoard, and acting as principal liaison between them and the CEO on sensitive issues.\nThe active involvement of our independent directors, combined with the qualifications and significant responsibilities of\nour Lead Director, provide balance on the Board and promote strong, independent oversight of our management and affairs.\nRole of the Board in Risk Oversight\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing risk management at NVIDIA and delegates oversight of appropriate topics to its\ncommittees. Our AC has the responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps our\nmanagement has taken to monitor and control these exposures. The AC also monitors compliance with certain legal and\nregulatory requirements and oversees the performance of our internal audit function.  Our NCGC monitors the effectiveness\nof our anonymous tip process and corporate governance guidelines, including whether they are successful in preventing\nillegal or improper liability-creating conduct, and oversees environmental, social and corporate governance risks, ranging\nfrom artificial intelligence to diversity and inclusion. Our CC assesses and monitors whether any of our compensation\npolicies and programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking. The Board exercises direct oversight of strategic\nrisks to NVIDIA and other risk areas not delegated to one of its committees, including business continuity and cybersecurity.\nManagement periodically provides information, including guidance on risk management and mitigation, to the Board or a\nrelevant committee.

    "corporate governance policies of the board of directors": "Corporate Governance Policies of the Board of Directors\nThe Board has documented our governance practices by adopting Corporate Governance Policies to ensure that the Board\nhas the necessary authority and processes in place to review and evaluate our business operations as needed and to make\ndecisions that are independent of our management. Our Corporate Governance Policies set forth the practices the Board\nfollows with respect to board composition and selection, regular evaluations of the Board and its committees, board meetings\nand involvement of senior management, chief executive officer performance evaluation, and board committees and\ncompensation. Our Corporate Governance Policies may be viewed under Governance in the Investor Relations section of\nour website at www.nvidia.com.\nExecutive Sessions of the Board\nAs required under Nasdaq’s listing standards, our independent directors have in the past met, and will continue to meet,\nregularly in scheduled executive sessions at which only independent directors are present. In Fiscal 2020, our independent\ndirectors met in executive session at all four of our scheduled quarterly Board meetings.\nIn addition, independent directors have in the past met, and will continue to meet, regularly in scheduled executive sessions\nwith our CEO. In Fiscal 2020, our independent directors met in executive session with the CEO at all four of our scheduled\nquarterly Board meetings.\nDirector Attendance at Annual Meeting\nWe do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board at our annual meetings. We generally\nschedule a Board meeting in conjunction with our annual meeting and expect that all of our directors will attend each annual\nmeeting, absent a valid reason.  All of our Board members attended our 2019 Meeting.\nBoard Self-Assessments\nIn Fiscal 2020, the NCGC oversaw an evaluation process, conducted at least annually, whereby outside corporate counsel\nfor NVIDIA interviewed each director to obtain his or her evaluation of the Board as a whole, and of the committees on which\nhe or she serves. The interviews solicited ideas from the directors about, among other things, improving the quality of Board\nand/or committee oversight effectiveness regarding strategic direction, financial and audit matters, executive compensation\nand other key matters.  The interviews also focused on Board process and identifying specific issues which should be\ndiscussed in the future.  After these evaluations were complete, our outside corporate counsel summarized the results,\nreviewed with our Lead Director, and then submitted the summary for discussion by the NCGC. \nIn response to the evaluations conducted in Fiscal 2020, our Board determined to strengthen oversight of the Company’s\noverall financial outlook process by the AC and the full Board, and to continue to prioritize its focus on the overall strength\nand competence of the Board and the diversity of experience, gender and ethnic background of its members.\nDirector Orientation and Continuing Education\nThe NCGC and our General Counsel are responsible for director orientation programs and for director continuing education\nprograms. Continuing education programs for directors may include a combination of internally developed materials and\npresentations, programs presented by third parties, and financial and administrative support for attendance at qualifying\nacademic or other independent programs. \nDirector Stock Ownership Guidelines\nThe Board believes that directors should hold a significant equity interest in NVIDIA. Our Corporate Governance Policies\nrequire each non-employee director to hold a number of shares of our common stock with a value equal to six times the\nannual cash retainer for Board service during the period in which he or she serves as a director (or six times the base\nsalary, in the case of the CEO).  The shares may include vested deferred stock, shares held in trust and shares held by\nimmediate family members. Non-employee directors have five years after their Board appointment to reach the ownership\nthreshold.  Our stock ownership guidelines are intended to further align director interests with stockholder interests.\nEach of our non-employee directors and Mr. Huang currently meets or exceeds the stock ownership requirements, with the\nexception of Mr. Neal, who joined our Board in 2019.\nHedging and Pledging Policy \nUnder our Insider Trading Policy, our directors, executive officers, employees, and their designees may not hedge their\nownership of NVIDIA stock, including but not limited to trading in options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments related\nto NVIDIA stock or debt to protect against a decline in the value of the Company’s stock.

    "director compensation": "Director Compensation\nThe CC reviews our non-employee director compensation program each year with the assistance of Exequity, who prepares\na comprehensive assessment of our program, including comparison to our Fiscal 2019 peer group used for executive\ncompensation purposes, an update on recent trends in director compensation, and a review of related corporate governance\nbest practices.  Following this review, the CC recommended no changes to our non-employee director compensation program\nfor the year starting on the date of our 2019 Meeting, which we refer to as the 2019 Program.\nThe CC subsequently recommended, and the Board approved, a mix of cash and equity awards with an approximate annual\nvalue of $300,000, which was slightly below the median total annual compensation paid by similarly-sized technology peer\ncompanies to their non-employee directors. We do not pay additional fees for serving as a chairperson or member of Board\ncommittees or for meeting attendance. Directors who are also employees do not receive fees or equity compensation for\nservice on the Board. \nCash Compensation \nThe cash portion of the annual retainer, representing $75,000 on an annualized basis, was paid quarterly.  Mr. Neal was\npaid the pro-rata portion of the annual cash retainer for his service on the Board from the date of his appointment in March\n2019 to the date of our 2019 Meeting.\nEquity Compensation\nThe value of the annual equity award, in the form of RSUs, or the 2019 Program RSUs, was $225,000.  The number of shares\nsubject to each RSU award equaled this value, divided by the average closing market price of our common stock over the\n60 calendar days ending the business day before the 2019 Meeting.  The RSUs were granted on the first trading day following\nthe date of our 2019 Meeting.\nTo correlate the vesting of the RSUs to the non-employee directors’ service on the Board and its committees over the\nfollowing year, the RSUs vested as to 50% on November 20, 2019 (the third Wednesday in November 2019) and will vest as\nto the remaining 50% on May 20, 2020 (the third Wednesday in May 2020).  If a non-employee director’s service terminates\ndue to death, his or her RSU grants will immediately vest in full for the benefit of his or her beneficiary.  Non-employee\ndirectors do not receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs.\nIn connection with Mr. Neal’s appointment to the Board in March 2019, he was granted on April 8, 2019: (a) an initial RSU\ngrant with a value of $225,000, which vests as to 1/6th of the shares approximately every six months, or the Initial Neal\nRSUs, and (b) the pro-rata portion of the annual RSUs for his service on the Board from the date of his appointment in March\n2019 to the date of our 2019 Meeting, which vested in full on May 15, 2019, or the 2018 Program Neal RSUs.  If Mr. Neal’s\nservice terminates due to death, his RSU grants will immediately fully vest. He does not receive dividend equivalents on\nunvested RSUs.\nDeferral of Settlement\nNon-employee directors could elect to defer settlement of RSUs upon vesting, to be issued on the earliest of (a) the date of\nthe director’s “separation from service” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)), unless a six month\ndelay would be required under such Section, (b) the date of a change in control of NVIDIA that also would constitute a “change\nin control event” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)), and (c) the third Wednesday in March of the\nyear elected by the director, which year must have been or be no earlier than (i) 2020 for the 2018 Program Neal RSUs, (ii)\n2021 for the 2019 Program RSUs, or (iii) 2023 for the Initial Neal RSUs.  Messrs. Gaither, Jones, McCaffery, and Neal, Dr.\nDrell, and Ms. Hudson elected to defer settlement of the RSUs granted to them in Fiscal 2020.\nOther Compensation/Benefits\nOur non-employee directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending Board and committee meetings and\ncontinuing educational programs pursuant to our Corporate Governance Policies. However, we do not offer change-in-\ncontrol benefits to our directors, except for the vesting acceleration provisions in our equity plans that apply to all holders\nof stock awards under such plans in the event that an acquirer does not assume or substitute for such awards.\n19",

The assessment focused on programs with variability of payout and\nthe ability of participants to directly affect payout and the controls over participant action and payout—specifically, the\nCompany’s variable cash compensation, equity compensation, and sales incentive compensation programs.  We identified\nthe key terms of these programs, potential concerns regarding risk taking behavior, and specific risk mitigation features.\nThe assessment was first presented to our Senior Vice President, Human Resources; our CFO; and our General Counsel,\nand then presented to the CC.\nThe CC considered the findings of the assessment described above and concluded that our compensation programs, which\nare structured to recognize both short-term and long-term contributions to the Company, do not create risks which are\nreasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.  \nThe CC believes that the following compensation design features guard against excessive risk-taking : \nCompensation Design Features that Guard Against Excessive Risk-Taking\nüOur compensation program encourages our employees to remain focused on both our short-term and long-\nterm goals\nüWe design our variable cash and PSU compensation programs for executives so that payouts are based on\nachievement of corporate performance targets, and we cap the potential award payout\nüWe have internal controls over our financial accounting and reporting which is used to measure and\ndetermine the eligible compensation awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUs\nüFinancial plan target goals and final awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUs are approved by\nthe CC and consistent with the annual operating plan approved by the full Board each year\nüMY PSUs are designed with a relative goal\nüWe have a compensation recovery policy applicable to all employees that allows NVIDIA to recover\ncompensation paid in situations of fraud or material financial misconduct\nüAll executive officer equity awards have multi-year vesting\nüWe have stock ownership guidelines that we believe are reasonable and are designed to align our executive\nofficers’ interests with those of our stockholders\nüWe enforce a “no-hedging” policy and a “no-pledging” policy involving our common stock which prevents our\nemployees from insulating themselves from the effects of NVIDIA stock price performance",

Our lead audit partner at PwC serves no more than five consecutive years\nin that role. Stockholder ratification of the AC’s selection of PwC is not required by our Bylaws or any other governing\ndocuments or laws. As a matter of good corporate governance, we are submitting the selection of PwC to our stockholders\nfor ratification. If our stockholders do not ratify the selection, the AC will reconsider whether or not to retain PwC. Even if\nthe selection is ratified, the AC in its sole discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public\naccounting firm at any time during the fiscal year if it determines that such a change would be in our best interests and\nthose of our stockholders. The AC believes it is in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders to retain PwC.\nWe expect that a representative of PwC will attend the 2020 Meeting.

Our AC determined that the rendering of\nservices other than audit services by PwC was compatible with maintaining PwC’s independence.\nPre-Approval Policies and Procedures\nThe AC has adopted policies and procedures for the pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services rendered\nby our independent registered public accounting firm. The policy generally permits pre-approvals of specified permissible\nservices in the defined categories of audit services, audit-related services and tax services up to specified amounts. Pre-\napproval may also be given as part of the AC’s approval of the scope of the engagement of our independent registered\npublic accounting firm or on an individual case-by-case basis before the independent registered public accounting firm is\nengaged to provide each service. In some cases the full AC provides pre-approval for up to a year related to a particular\ndefined task or scope. In other cases, the AC has delegated power to Mr. McCaffery, the Chairperson of our AC, to pre-approve\nadditional non-audit services if the need for the service was unanticipated and approval is required prior to the next scheduled\nmeeting of the AC.

    "report of the audit committee of the board of directors": "Report of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors\nThe material in this report is not “soliciting material,” is not deemed “filed” with the SEC and is not to be incorporated by reference\nin any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, whether\nmade before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing, except to the extent\nspecifically incorporated by reference therein.\nThe Audit Committee, or AC, oversees accounting, financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting, financial\npractices and audit activities of NVIDIA and its subsidiaries. The AC reviews the results and scope of the audit and other\nservices provided by the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews financial statements and the accounting\npolicies followed by NVIDIA prior to the issuance of the financial statements with both management and the independent\nregistered public accounting firm.\nManagement is responsible for the financial reporting process, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP , the system of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and the procedures designed to facilitate compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws\nand regulations. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , or PwC, our independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2020,\nwas responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and issuing a report on the\nconsolidated financial statements and of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 26,\n2020.  PwC’s judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles and such other matters are\nrequired to be disclosed to the AC under applicable standards. The AC oversees these processes. Also, the AC has ultimate\nauthority and responsibility to select, evaluate and, when appropriate, terminate the independent registered public\naccounting firm. The AC approves audit fees and non-audit services provided by and fees paid to the independent registered\npublic accounting firm.\nNVIDIA has an internal audit function that reports to the AC. This function is responsible for objectively reviewing and\nevaluating the adequacy, effectiveness and quality of our system of internal controls and the operating effectiveness of our\nbusiness processes. The AC approves an annual internal audit plan and monitors the activities and performance of our\ninternal audit function throughout the year to ensure the plan objectives are carried out and met.\nThe AC members are not professional accountants or auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify\nthe activities of management or the independent registered public accounting firm. The AC does not plan or conduct audits,\ndetermine that our financial statements are complete and accurate and in accordance with GAAP or assess our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. The AC relies, without additional independent verification, on the information provided by\nour management and on the representations made by management that the financial statements have been prepared with\nintegrity and objectivity, and the opinion of PwC that such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP .\nIn this context, the AC reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2020 with\nmanagement and our internal control over financial reporting with management and PwC. Specifically, the AC discussed\nwith PwC the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit\nCommittees,  as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. We have received from PwC the written\ndisclosures and letter required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding\nPwC’s communications with the AC concerning independence. The AC also considered whether the provision of certain\npermitted non-audit services by PwC is compatible with PwC’s independence and discussed PwC’s independence with PwC.\nBased on the AC’s review and discussions, the AC recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of NVIDIA for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020.\nAUDIT COMMITTEE\nDawn Hudson\nMichael G.

    "director qualifications and nomination of directors": "Director Qualifications and Nomination of Directors\nThe NCGC identifies, reviews and assesses the qualifications of existing and potential directors and selects nominees for \nrecommendation to the Board for approval. The committee is committed to Board diversity and shall consider a \nnominee’s background and experience to ensure that a broad range of perspectives is represented on the Board.  The \nNCGC may conduct any appropriate and necessary inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications of possible \ncandidates, and may also engage a professional search firm to identify and assist the committee in identifying, \nevaluating, and conducting due diligence on potential director nominees.  The NCGC has not established specific age, \ngender, education, experience, or skill requirements for potential members, and instead considers numerous factors \nregarding the nominee taking into account our current and future business models, including the following: \n•Integrity and candor\n•Independence\n•Senior leadership and operational experience\n•Professional, technical and industry knowledge\n•Financial expertise\n•Financial community experience (including as an investor in \nother companies)\n•Marketing, communications and brand management \nbackground\n•Governance and public company board experience\n•Experience with emerging technologies and new business \nmodels\n•Regulatory, legal and risk management expertise•Diversity, including race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender or \nmembership in another underrepresented community\n•Human capital management experience\n•Experience in academia\n•Willingness and ability to devote substantial time and effort to \nBoard responsibilities and Company oversight\n•Ability to represent the interests of the stockholders as a \nwhole rather than special interest groups or constituencies\n•All relationships between the proposed nominee and any of \nour stockholders, competitors, customers, suppliers or other \npersons with a relationship to NVIDIA\n•For nominees for re-election, overall service to NVIDIA, \nincluding past attendance at Board and committee meetings \nand participation and contributions to the activities of the \nBoard\nThe NCGC and the Board understand the importance of Board refreshment, and strive to maintain an appropriate \nbalance of tenure, diversity, professional experience and backgrounds, skills, and education on the Board.  While the \nBoard benefits from the experience and institutional knowledge that our longer-serving directors bring, it has also \nbrought in new perspectives and ideas by appointing two new directors in the past year: John O. Dabiri, a professor of \naeronautics and mechanical engineering at the California Institute of Technology, and Aarti Shah, an IT, digital health, \ncybersecurity, and advanced analytics & data sciences executive at Eli Lilly and Company.  Our longer-tenured directors \nare familiar with our operations and business areas and have the perspective of overseeing our activities from a variety \nof economic and competitive environments. Our new directors have brought expertise in brand development and \ncybersecurity and familiarity with technology developments at leading academic institutions that are important to \nsupporting NVIDIA as it enters new markets.  Each year, the NCGC and Board review each director’s individual \nperformance, including the director’s past contributions, outside experiences and activities, and committee participation, \nand determine how his or her experience and skills continue to add value to NVIDIA and the Board.\n12",

COVID-19 has \nalso caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets and global economic activity, and has impacted the  \nsupply chain, including logistical services and component supply, topics on which the Board and its committees were \nbriefed regularly.  Additionally, the Board has overseen the execution of management’s initiatives to protect the health \nand safety of our workforce, including closure of our offices, compliance with shelter-in-place orders and the temporary \nprohibition on most business travel, and to support NVIDIANs and their families during a challenging year by moving up \nour annual focal review to accelerate the timing of raises and implementing a one-week company-wide shut down in \nDecember for our people to recharge.\nCorporate Governance Policies of the Board of Directors\nThe Board has adopted Corporate Governance Policies to ensure that it has the necessary authority and processes in \nplace to review and evaluate our business operations as needed and to make decisions that are independent of our \nmanagement.

The interviews solicited ideas from the directors about, among other things, improving the \nquality of Board and/or committee oversight effectiveness regarding strategic direction, financial and audit matters, \nexecutive compensation, acquisition activity and other key matters.  The interviews also focused on Board process and \nidentifying specific issues which should be discussed in the future.  After these evaluations were complete, our outside \ncorporate counsel summarized the results, reviewed them with our Lead Director, and then submitted the summary for \ndiscussion by the NCGC. \nIn response to the evaluations conducted in Fiscal 2021, our Board determined to focus recruiting efforts on director \ncandidates with diversity of gender and/or racial/ethnic background, to further strengthen our director onboarding \nprograms, and to dedicate additional time to certain Board agenda items such as cybersecurity, diversity and inclusion, \nand other ESG matters.\nDirector Orientation and Continuing Education\nThe NCGC and our General Counsel are responsible for new director orientation and for administering or approving \neligible director continuing education programs.

    "environmental, social and corporate governance": "Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance\nNVIDIA invents the computing technologies that enable scientists, engineers, designers, researchers, and developers to \nimprove lives everywhere and address global challenges. We integrate sound ESG principles and practices into every \naspect of the Company. The following section provides an overview of these principles and practices.  More information \ncan be found on the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website and in our 2020 Corporate Social \nResponsibility Report, which was prepared in accordance with the Core Option of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) \nStandards: Core Option and is responsive to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards for the \nTechnology and Communications sector, Semiconductor industry. Information contained on our website is not \nincorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement or any other report we file with the SEC.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our \nstakeholders. As of the end of Fiscal 2021, we had 18,975 employees in 29 countries. 13,532 were engaged in research \nand development and 5,443 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented \nemployees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and research and development \npersonnel. The primary ways in which we seek to do this are summarized below.\nRecruitment\nThe demand for talent in new markets, such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. Our intern and new \ncollege graduate recruiting programs are a sustainable source of talent. We partner with higher education institutions \nglobally to develop our candidate pipelines, recruit at industry conferences, and encourage our employees to submit \nreferrals, with over 36% of hires coming from internal recommendations. Collaborations with our community resource \ngroups improve how we reach and attract minority candidates.\nDevelopment and Retention\nTo support employee advancement, we provide training on-the-job through coaching, feedback, and role modeling. We \nhave a rich library of live and on-demand learning experiences such as workshops, panel discussions, speaker-based \nforums, and internally focused technical conferences. We curate learning libraries around our most common \ndevelopment needs, provide the latest technical platforms to support self-paced learning, and regularly listen to learner \nfeedback through internal messaging channels to improve and update those topics. We offer tuition reimbursement \nprograms and subsidize advanced technical education programs and online technical certifications. We encourage \ninternal mobility through career expos and coaching, as well as foster mentorship connections and provide trained \ncoaches as additional developmental support. Our strong partnerships with internal community resource groups allow \nus to personalize programs to address specific career development needs.\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use several listening mechanisms such as pulse surveys, a \nsuggestion box, and an anonymous third-party hotline.\nIn fiscal year 2021, our overall turnover rate was 3.8%.\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s \nfuture. Employees receive equity (except where unavailable due to local regulations) with a realized value that is tied to \nour stock price performance and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with \nthose of our stockholders.\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ well-being, including 401(k) programs in \nthe U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours and \ntime off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit \nofferings globally and are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including assistance for \nmilitary members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new parents, and those who wish to become \nparents.\nSafety and COVID-19\nWe support our people and their families in making their health a top priority. We implemented global protocols to slow \nthe spread of COVID-19 and to keep our workforce safe by closing our offices around the world in March 2020 for all \nexcept essential workers. We also eliminated most business travel. We provided our employees with resources to work \n32",
    "director compensation": "Director Compensation \nThe CC reviews our non-employee director compensation program each year with the assistance of Exequity LLP, the \nCC’s independent compensation consultant, who prepares a comprehensive assessment of our program, including \ncomparison to our Fiscal 2020 peer group used for executive compensation purposes, an update on recent trends in \ndirector compensation, and a review of related corporate governance best practices.  Following this review, the CC \nrecommended no changes to our non-employee director compensation program for the year starting on the date of our \n2020 Meeting, which we refer to as the 2020 Program.\nThe CC subsequently recommended, and the Board approved, a mix of cash and equity awards for each non-employee \ndirector with an approximate annual value of $300,000, which was slightly below the median total annual compensation \npaid by similarly sized technology peer companies to their non-employee directors. We do not pay additional fees for \nserving as a Lead Director, chairperson or member of Board committees or for meeting attendance. Directors who are \nalso employees do not receive fees or equity compensation for service on the Board. \nCash Compensation \nThe cash portion of the annual retainer, representing $75,000 on an annualized basis, was paid quarterly.  Each of Drs. \nDabiri and Shah were paid the pro-rata portion of the annual cash retainer for service on the Board from the date of \nappointment to the date of our 2021 Meeting. \nEquity Compensation\nThe value of the annual equity award, in the form of RSUs, or the 2020 Program RSUs, was $225,000.  The number of \nshares subject to each RSU award equaled this value, divided by the average closing market price of our common stock \nover the 60 calendar days ending the business day before the 2020 Meeting.  The RSUs were granted on the first trading \nday following the date of our 2020 Meeting.\nTo correlate the vesting of the RSUs to the non-employee directors’ service on the Board and its committees over the \nfollowing year, 50% of the 2020 Program RSUs vested on November 18, 2020 (the third Wednesday in November 2020) \nand the remaining 50% will vest on May 19, 2021 (the third Wednesday in May 2021).  If a non-employee director’s \nservice terminates due to death, his or her RSU grants will immediately vest in full for the benefit of his or her \nbeneficiary.  Non-employee directors do not receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs.\nIn connection with Dr. Dabiri’s appointment to the Board in July 2020, he was granted on August 10, 2020: (a) an initial \nRSU grant with a value of $225,000, which vests as to 1/6th of the shares approximately every six months, or the Initial \nDabiri RSUs, and (b) an annual RSU grant equal to the grant value of the 2020 Program RSUs, pro-rated for the period of \ntime from Dr. Dabiri’s appointment in July 2020 to the date of our 2021 Meeting, which vest on the same schedule as the \n2020 Program RSUs, with the pro-rated amount vesting on November 18, 2020 and the remainder vesting on May 19, \n2021, or the 2020 Program Dabiri RSUs. The number of shares subject to the Initial Dabiri RSUs equaled the value of the \ngrant, divided by the average closing market price of our common stock over the 60 calendar days ending the business \nday before Dr. Dabiri’s appointment to the Board. The number of shares subject to the 2020 Program Dabiri RSUs \nequaled the number of shares that would have been granted to him pursuant to the 2020 Program RSUs had Dr. Dabiri \nbeen in service as of the 2020 Meeting, but pro-rated to reflect the period of service between the date of appointment of \nDr. Dabiri to the Board and the date of the 2021 Meeting. If Dr. Dabiri’s service terminates due to death, his RSU grants \nwill immediately fully vest. He does not receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs. The grants to Dr. Dabiri occurred \non the sixth business day of the calendar month following the date of his appointment, in alignment with our typical \ngrant procedures for new employees.  \nIn connection with Dr. Shah’s appointment to the Board in November 2020, she was granted on December 8, 2020: (a) an \ninitial RSU grant with a value of $225,000, which vests as to 1/6th of the shares approximately every six months, or the \nInitial Shah RSUs, and (b) an annual RSU grant equal to the grant value of the 2020 Program RSUs, pro-rated for the \nperiod of time from Dr. Shah’s appointment in November 2020 to the date of our 2021 Meeting, which will vest in full on \nMay 19, 2021, or the 2020 Program Shah RSUs. The number of shares subject to the Initial Shah RSUs equaled the value \nof the grant, divided by the average closing market price of our common stock over the 60 calendar days ending the \nbusiness day before Dr. Shah’s appointment to the Board. The number of shares subject to the 2020 Program Shah \nRSUs equaled the number of shares that would have been granted to her pursuant to the 2020 Program RSUs had Dr. \nShah been in service as of the 2020 Meeting, but pro-rated to reflect the period of service between the date of \nappointment of Dr. Shah to the Board and the date of the 2021 Meeting.

The overall design of the program \nremained consistent year-over-year, with the following Fiscal 2021 NEO pay highlights:\nComponents of Pay\nBASE SALARY + VARIABLE CASH + EQUITY\n based on annual revenue RSUs  vesting over 4 years (all NEOs other than our CEO)\nSY PSUs  based on annual Non-GAAP Operating Income, \nvesting over 4 years\nMY PSUs  based on 3-year TSR relative to the S&P 500, \nvesting after completion of the performance period\nTarget Pay Adjustments Performance Achievement; Maximum Payouts\n•Increase in proportion of “at-risk” target pay to 94%  of \nCEO target pay and 88%  of other NEO target pay•Revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Income each \nadjusted to exclude the impact of acquisitions \ncompleted during Fiscal 2021\n•Increased CEO target variable cash to 150% of base \nsalary (representing 25th percentile of peers)\n•No other changes to NEO base salary or target\nvariable cash for the third consecutive yearRevenue , as adjusted, \nexceeded Stretch \nOperating Plan goal\nVariable cash payout \nat 200%  of target\n•Target equity increased by 51% for CEO and by  \n111% for other NEOs, after no significant increases in \nthe last three yearsNon-GAAP Operating \nIncome , as adjusted, \nexceeded Stretch \nOperating Plan goal\n200%  (150%  for CEO) \nof target PSU shares \neligible to vest\nIncreased Performance Goals3-year relative TSR \nexceeded Stretch goal\n200%  (150%  for CEO) \nof target PSU shares \neligible to vest•Fiscal 2021 revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Income \nThreshold goals set above Fiscal 2020 performance\n•No adjustments to performance goals due to \nCOVID-19\n42",
    "risk analysis of our compensation plans": "Although the CC will continue to consider tax implications as one factor in determining executive compensation, the CC \nalso looks at other factors in making its decisions and retains the flexibility to provide compensation for the NEOs in a \nmanner consistent with the goals of the Company’s executive compensation program and the best interests of the \nCompany and its stockholders, which may include providing for compensation that is not deductible by the Company due \nto the deduction limit under Section 162(m). The CC also retains the flexibility to modify compensation that was initially \nintended to be exempt from the deduction limit under Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are \nconsistent with the Company’s business needs.\nOur CC also considers the impact of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, and in general, our executive plans and \nprograms are designed to comply with the requirements of that section to avoid the possible adverse tax consequences \nthat may arise from non-compliance.\nUnder FASB ASC Topic 718, the Company is required to estimate and record an expense for each award of equity \ncompensation over the vesting period of the award. We record share-based compensation expense on an ongoing basis \naccording to FASB ASC Topic 718.\nRisk Analysis of Our Compensation Plans\nWith the oversight of the CC, members from the Company’s Legal, Human Resources and Finance departments, as well \nas Exequity, the independent consultant engaged by the CC, performed an assessment of the Company’s compensation \nprograms and policies for Fiscal 2021 as generally applicable to our employees to ascertain any potential material risks \nthat may be created by our compensation programs.  The assessment focused on programs with variability of payout \nand the ability of participants to directly affect payout and the controls over participant action and payout—specifically, \nthe Company’s variable cash compensation, equity compensation, and sales incentive compensation programs.  We \nidentified the key terms of these programs, potential concerns regarding risk taking behavior, and specific risk \nmitigation features.  The assessment was first presented to our Senior Vice President, Human Resources; our CFO; and \nour General Counsel, and then presented to the CC.\nThe CC considered the findings of the assessment described above and concluded that our compensation programs, \nwhich are structured to recognize both short-term and long-term contributions to the Company, do not create risks \nwhich are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.  \nThe CC believes that the following compensation design features guard against excessive risk-taking : \nüOur compensation program encourages our employees to remain focused on both our short-term and long-\nterm goals\nüWe design our variable cash and PSU compensation programs for executives so that payouts are based on \nachievement of corporate performance targets, and we cap the potential award payout\nüWe have internal controls over our financial accounting and reporting which is used to measure and \ndetermine the eligible compensation awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUs\nüFinancial plan target goals and final awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUs are approved by \nthe CC and consistent with the annual operating plan approved by the full Board each year\nü MY PSUs are designed with a relative goal\nüWe have a compensation recovery policy applicable to all employees that allows NVIDIA to recover \ncompensation paid in situations of fraud or material financial misconduct\nü All executive officer equity awards have multi-year vesting\nüWe have stock ownership guidelines that we believe are reasonable and are designed to align our executive \nofficers’ interests with those of our stockholders\nüWe enforce a “no-hedging” policy and a “no-pledging” policy involving our common stock which prevents our \nemployees from insulating themselves from the effects of NVIDIA stock price performance\n52",

Approval of an amendment to our Charter to increase the number of authorized shares of \ncommon stock from 2 billion shares to 4 billion shares.\nVote required :  A majority of the shares outstanding.\nEffect of abstentions :  Same as a vote AGAINST.\nEffect of broker non-votes :  Same as a vote AGAINST.\nFor purposes of this Proposal 4, the term “ Proposed Amendment ” refers to an amendment and restatement of our \nCharter.\nDescription of the Proposed Amendment\nOur Charter currently authorizes the issuance of up to two billion shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, \nand two million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.\nOn April 7, 2021, our Board adopted resolutions approving an amendment to the Charter to increase the number of \nauthorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares. Our Board is recommending the \nproposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to provide adequate shares of common stock \nfor general corporate purposes, as further described below.  The Board determined that the Proposed Amendment is \nadvisable and in the best interests of the Company and directed that the proposed Amendment be submitted for \nadoption and approval by stockholders at the Meeting.\nThe full text of the Proposed Amendment is set forth in Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. The Proposed Amendment \nwould not affect the number of authorized shares of preferred stock. Currently, there are no shares of preferred stock \nissued and outstanding. \nPurposes and Effect of the Proposed Amendment and Effect of Stockholder Approval\nAs of April 5, 2021, we have 622,383,615 shares of common stock outstanding and the number of authorized shares of \nour common stock is two billion.  Following the filing of the Proposed Amendment, the number of authorized shares of \nour common stock will be increased to four billion. \nIf our stockholders adopt and approve the Proposed Amendment, the Proposed Amendment will become effective on the \ndate that it is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. If the Proposed Amendment is adopted and \napproved by the stockholders, the Company currently anticipates filing the Proposed Amendment with the Secretary of \nState of the State of Delaware on or around June 4, 2021. If the Proposed Amendment is not adopted and approved by \nthe stockholders or is subsequently abandoned by the Board, the Proposed Amendment will not be filed with the \nSecretary of State of the State of Delaware and our authorized number of shares of common stock will remain at two \nbillion. Further, if the Board subsequently determines not to proceed with the filing of the Proposed Amendment, it will \nnot be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware even if it is approved by stockholders. \nAs a general matter, the increase in our authorized but unissued shares of common stock as a result of the Proposed \nAmendment would enable the Board to issue additional shares of common stock in its discretion from time to time for \ngeneral corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, expanding our business through mergers and acquisitions, \nincluding shares we would be obligated to issue in connection with the pending acquisition of Arm Limited; stock \ndividends and/or stock splits; providing equity incentives to employees, officers or directors; and the raising of additional \ncapital.  Such issuances would occur without further action or approval of our stockholders and would be subject to and \nlimited by any rules or listing requirements of Nasdaq or of any other applicable rules or regulations.

The \nNCGC may conduct appropriate and necessary inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications of possible candidates \nand may engage a professional search firm to identify and assist the committee in identifying, evaluating, and \nconducting due diligence on potential director nominees. The NCGC has not established specific age, gender, education, \nexperience, or skill requirements for potential members, and instead considers numerous factors regarding the \nnominee taking into account our current and future business models, including the following: \n• Integrity and candor\n• Independence\n• Senior leadership and operational experience\n• Professional, technical and industry knowledge\n• Financial expertise\n• Financial community experience (including as an investor in \nother companies)\n• Marketing, communications and brand management \nbackground\n• Governance and public company board experience\n• Experience with emerging technologies and new business \nmodels\n• Regulatory, legal and risk management expertise, including in \ncybersecurity matters• Diversity, including race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender or \nmembership in another underrepresented community\n• Human capital management experience\n• Experience in academia\n• Willingness and ability to devote substantial time and effort to \nBoard responsibilities and Company oversight\n• Ability to represent the interests of the stockholders as a \nwhole rather than special interest groups or constituencies\n• All relationships between the proposed nominee and any of \nour stockholders, competitors, customers, suppliers or other \npersons with a relationship to NVIDIA\n• For nominees for re-election, overall service to NVIDIA, \nincluding past attendance, participation and contributions to \nthe activities of the Board and its committees\nThe NCGC and the Board understand the importance of Board refreshment, and strive to maintain an appropriate \nbalance of tenure, diversity, professional experience and backgrounds, skills, and education on the Board.

Our longer-tenured \ndirectors are familiar with our operations and business areas and have the perspective of overseeing our activities from \na variety of economic and competitive environments. Our newer directors have brought expertise in brand development \nand cybersecurity and familiarity with technology developments at leading academic institutions that are important to \nsupporting NVIDIA as it enters new markets.  Each year, the NCGC and Board review each director’s individual \nperformance, including the director’s past contributions, outside experiences and activities, and committee participation, \nand determine how his or her experience and skills continue to add value to NVIDIA and the Board.\n13",

The interviews solicit ideas from the directors about, among other things, improving the quality of Board \nand/or committee oversight effectiveness regarding strategic direction, financial and audit matters, executive \ncompensation, acquisition activity and other key matters.  The interviews also focus on Board process and identifying \nspecific issues which should be discussed in the future.  After these evaluations are complete, our outside corporate \ncounsel summarizes the results, reviews them with our Lead Director, and then submits the summary for discussion by \nthe NCGC. \nIn response to the evaluations conducted in Fiscal 2022, our Board focused on the Company’s supply chain and \nacquisition activities, requested that the CC report on the Company’s return to office initiatives, as well as oversee \nadditional topics on diversity and inclusion, and began transitioning to in-person Board and committee meetings during \nFiscal 2023.\nDirector Orientation and Continuing Education\nThe NCGC and our General Counsel are responsible for new director orientation and for administering or approving \neligible director continuing education programs.

The shares may include vested deferred stock, shares held \nin trust and shares held by immediate family members, but unvested or unexercised equity awards do not count for \npurposes of this ownership calculation.

    "environmental, social and corporate governance": "Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance \nNVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. We integrate sound ESG \nprinciples and practices into every aspect of the Company. The NCGC is responsible for reviewing and discussing with \nmanagement our practices concerning ESG. The CC is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our \nhuman capital management practices, including diversity and inclusion matters. We undertake an annual analysis to \nensure that our ESG priorities remain aligned with stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and \nopportunities. These issues are important for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern \nto NVIDIA and our stakeholders. \nThe following section provides an overview of some of these principles and practices. More information can be found on \nthe CSR section of our website and in our annual CSR Report. Information contained on our website or in our annual CSR \nReport is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with the  SEC. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk \nFactors” in our Form 10-K for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to ESG.\nClimate Change\nIn the area of sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks, including \ncurrent and emerging regulations and market impacts. \nIn our CSR Report, we report several metrics related to our environmental impact, our most recent full reporting year \nbeing Fiscal 2021, with our Fiscal 2022 metrics expected to be published in May 2022. There has been no material \nimpact to capital expenditures, our results of operations or competitive position associated with global sustainability \nregulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of Fiscal 2025, our goal is to purchase or \ngenerate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and data centers.\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance \nsupercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPUs \nare inherently more energy efficient than other forms of computing because they are optimized for throughput and \nperformance per watt rather than absolute performance. GPU servers can be 40x more energy efficient than traditional \nCPU servers for AI inference workloads. The power efficiency of our products is evidenced by our continued strong \npresence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 23 of the top 25 systems on the \nNovember 2021 Green500 list.\nWe plan to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change. The system will \nbuild a digital twin of the Earth on our Omniverse platform, enable scientists to do ultra-high-resolution climate \nmodeling, and put mitigation and adaptation tools into the hands of cities and nations so they can act with more urgency. \nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our \nstakeholders. As of January 30, 2022, we had 22,473 employees in 32 countries. 16,242 were engaged in research and \ndevelopment and 6,231 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented \nemployees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\nRecruitment\nThe demand for talent in new markets such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. With differentiated \nhiring strategies for university, professional, executive, and for diversity, we have been successful in attracting top talent \nto NVIDIA.\nWe attract global talent from universities, collaborations with college programs, professional organization affiliations, \nindustry conferences, community resource group participation, direct sourcing and outreach. Our employees play an \nimportant part in recruiting, with over 39% of our new hires coming from employee referrals.\n30",
    "director compensation": "Director Compensation \nThe CC reviews our non-employee director compensation program annually with the assistance of Exequity LLP, the \nCC’s independent compensation consultant. Exequity LLP prepares a comprehensive assessment of our program, \nincluding comparison to the peer group of companies used for executive compensation purposes most recently \napproved by the CC at the time of assessment, an update on recent trends in director compensation, and a review of \nrelated corporate governance best practices.  \nFor our non-employee director compensation program for the year starting on our 2021 Meeting, or the 2021 Program, \nthe CC recommended, and the Board approved, a mix of cash and equity awards with an approximate annual value of \n$340,000. This was below the median total annual compensation paid by the peer group to their non-employee directors. \nWe do not pay additional fees for serving as a Lead Director, chairperson or member of Board committees or for \nmeeting attendance. Directors who are also employees do not receive fees or equity compensation for service on the \nBoard. \nCash Compensation \nThe cash portion of the annual retainer, representing $85,000 on an annualized basis, was paid quarterly.  \nEquity Compensation\nThe target value of the annual RSU equity award, or the 2021 Program RSUs, was $255,000.  The number of shares \nsubject to each RSU award equaled this value, divided by the 30-calendar day trailing average closing price of our \ncommon stock ending the business day before the 2021 Meeting, which was used instead of the stock price on the date \nof grant to provide a value less susceptible to possible volatility in the market.  The RSUs were granted on the first \ntrading day following the date of our 2021 Meeting, The CC understands that using a historical average stock price can \nresult in the ultimate grant date value of an award as required to be reported in the Director Compensation Table under \nASC 718 being different than the target equity value. The CC considered various approaches to granting awards and \ndetermined the process described above is appropriate at this time.\nTo correlate the vesting of the RSUs to the non-employee directors’ service on the Board and its committees over the \nfollowing year, 50% of the 2021 Program RSUs vested on the third Wednesday in November 2021 and 50% will vest on \nthe third Wednesday in May 2022.  If a non-employee director’s service terminates due to death, his or her RSU grants \nwill immediately vest in full for the benefit of his or her beneficiary.  Non-employee directors do not receive dividend \nequivalents on unvested RSUs.\nNon-employee directors can elect to defer settlement of RSUs upon vesting for tax planning purposes to the earlier of (i) \na future year (no sooner than 2023 for the 2021 Program RSUs) or (ii) in accordance with the tax rules under Section \n409A of the Internal Revenue Code, in connection with the director’s cessation of service or certain change in control \nevents. Messrs. Jones and McCaffery, Dr. Shah and Ms. Hudson elected to defer settlement of the RSUs granted to them \nin Fiscal 2022.\nOther Compensation/Benefits\nOur non-employee directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending Board and committee meetings and \ncontinuing educational programs pursuant to our Corporate Governance Policies. We do not offer change-in-control \nbenefits to our directors, except for the vesting acceleration provisions in our equity plans that apply to all holders of \nstock awards under such plans if an acquirer does not assume or substitute for such awards.\n33",

In accordance with our Corporate Governance Policies and the NCGC Charter, \nthe NCGC is committed to Board diversity and shall consider a nominee’s background and experience to ensure that a \nbroad range of perspectives is represented on the Board.  The NCGC may conduct appropriate and necessary inquiries \ninto the backgrounds and qualifications of possible candidates and may engage a professional search firm to identify and \nassist the committee in identifying, evaluating, and conducting due diligence on potential director nominees. The NCGC \nhas not established specific age, gender, education, experience, or skill requirements for potential members, and instead \nconsiders numerous factors regarding the nominee taking into account our current and future business models, including \nthe following: \n•Integrity and candor\n•Independence\n•Senior leadership and operational experience\n•Professional, technical and industry knowledge\n•Financial expertise\n•Financial community experience (including as an investor in \nother companies)\n•Marketing, communications and brand management \nbackground\n•Governance and public company board experience\n•Experience with emerging technologies and new business \nmodels\n•Regulatory, legal and risk management expertise, including in \ncybersecurity matters•Diversity, including race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender or \nmembership in another underrepresented community\n•Human capital management experience\n•Experience in academia\n•Willingness and ability to devote substantial time and effort to \nBoard responsibilities and Company oversight\n•Ability to represent the interests of the stockholders as a whole \nrather than special interest groups or constituencies\n•All relationships between the proposed nominee and any of our \nstockholders, competitors, customers, suppliers or other \npersons with a relationship to NVIDIA\n•For nominees for re-election, overall service to NVIDIA, including \npast attendance, participation and contributions to the \nactivities of the Board and its committees\nThe NCGC and the Board understand the importance of Board refreshment, and strive to maintain an appropriate balance \nof tenure, diversity, professional experience and backgrounds, skills, and education on the Board. While the Board \nbenefits from the experience and institutional knowledge that our longer-serving directors bring, it has also brought in \nnew perspectives and ideas through the appointment of two new directors since 2020. The Board also regularly rotates \nmembership on and who is appointed as chairperson of its committees to help promote a diversity of viewpoints on the \nBoard committees. Our longer-tenured directors are familiar with our operations and business areas and have the \nperspective of overseeing our activities from a variety of economic and competitive environments. Our newer directors \nhave brought expertise in brand development and cybersecurity and familiarity with technology developments at leading \nacademic institutions that are important to supporting NVIDIA as it enters new markets.  Each year, the NCGC and Board \nreview each director’s individual performance, including the director’s past contributions, outside experiences and \nactivities, and committee participation, and determine how his or her experience and skills continue to add value to \nNVIDIA and the Board.\nThe Board and the NCGC have identified and continue to seek highly qualified women and individuals from \nunderrepresented groups to include in the initial pool of potential director nominees. The Board’s commitment to \nachieving a diverse and inclusive membership is demonstrated by our director nominees. Three of our directors are \nwomen and three are ethnically and/or racially diverse. Our two newest members enhance the Board’s gender, ethnic and/\nor racial diversity. We expect Board diversity to increase before our 2024 Meeting.\n16",

    "information about the board of directors and corporate governance": "Information About the Board of Directors and Corporate Governance\nIndependence of the Members of the Board of Directors\nNasdaq rules and our Corporate Governance Policies (as further described below) require that a majority of our directors \nnot have a relationship that would interfere with their exercise of independent judgment in carrying out their \nresponsibilities and that they meet any other qualification requirements required by the SEC and Nasdaq.  \nDr. Drell has served as Provost of Stanford University since 2017. NVIDIA has entered into transactions, relationships or \narrangements during the past three fiscal years with Stanford University for the support of research and activities \nrelated to NVIDIA’s industry and line of business. The amount that NVIDIA paid in each of the last three fiscal years to \nStanford University, and the amount received in each of those years by NVIDIA from Stanford University, did not, in any of \nthose years, exceed the greater of $200,000 or 1% of either entity’s consolidated gross revenues. \nAfter considering the above arrangements, and all other relevant relationships and transactions, our Board determined \nthat, except for Mr. Huang, all of our directors are “independent” as defined by Nasdaq’s rules and regulations.  The Board \nalso determined that all members of our AC, CC and NCGC are independent under applicable Nasdaq listing standards, \nand that each of Messrs. McCaffery, Perry and Seawell of the AC are “audit committee financial experts” as defined under \napplicable SEC rules.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nOur Board ensures that each member has an equal voice in the affairs and the management of NVIDIA by having an \nindependent Lead Director, rather than a chairperson, which the Board believes best serves our stockholders.  Our Lead \nDirector is an integral part of our Board structure and critical to our effective corporate governance.  The independent \ndirectors consider the role and designation of the person to serve as Lead Director on an annual basis . The Board \nrecognizes that different board leadership structures may be appropriate under different circumstances and its annual \nreview includes consideration of whether having a Lead Director continues to best meet NVIDIA’s evolving needs and \nserves in the best interest of its stockholders.  \nOur Board believes its current leadership structure is appropriate because the active involvement of each of our \nindependent directors, combined with the qualifications, significant responsibilities and strong oversight by our Lead \nDirector, provide balance on the Board and promote independent oversight of our management and affairs. Our Board \nalso believes its current leadership structure is appropriate because it effectively allocates authority, responsibility and \noversight between management and our independent directors and it provides the right foundation to pursue the \nCompany’s strategic and operational objectives, particularly in light of the evolution of our business and operating \nenvironment. Our CEO has primary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company, \nand the Lead Director facilitates our Board’s independent oversight of management, promotes communication between \nmanagement and our Board, and supports our Board’s consideration of key governance matters. This arrangement \npromotes open dialogue among the Board, including discussions of the independent directors during quarterly executive \nsessions without the presence of our CEO, which are led by our Lead Director. We believe that our current structure best \nserves stockholders, without the need to appoint a person to serve as chairperson of the Board.\nUnder our corporate governance policies, the Board may select a chairperson in its discretion, but, if it does not, a Lead \nDirector shall be designated annually by a majority of the independent directors and identified in the Company’s proxy \nstatement. These policies help to ensure a robust independent leadership structure on our Board. \nWhile the Board has the discretion to consider other leadership structures, including having the Lead Director (or \nchairperson, if any) and CEO roles filled by a single individual, it would only consider a change if it best aligned with the \ninterests of our stockholders, management, and the Board, and it complied with applicable laws and regulations. If in the \nfuture our CEO were to take a leadership position on the Board, such as chairperson, we expect that the Board would \ncontinue to appoint an independent Lead Director to maintain a balanced and strong leadership structure and otherwise \nrepresent the Board independently from the Company’s management team.

The \nLead Director makes themself available for consultation with major stockholders pursuant to our Corporate Governance \nPolicies. For the past five years that Mr. Perry served as Lead Director, he participated in our annual stockholder outreach \nmeetings.

Each of these committees operates under a written charter, \nwhich may be viewed under Governance in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nvidia.com.  \nCommittee assignments are determined based on background and the expertise which individual directors can bring to a \ncommittee. Our Board believes regular committee rotations are a good corporate governance practice which introduces \ndiverse perspectives and ideas, more fully informs its members regarding the full scope of the Board and our activities, \nand benefits each committee and the Board as a whole.

    "role of the board in risk oversight": "Role of the Board in Risk Oversight\nThe Board oversees risk management at NVIDIA and delegates oversight of appropriate topics to its committees. The \noversight responsibility of our Board and its committees is enabled by management reporting processes, including our \nERM process, that are designed to provide visibility to our Board about the identification, assessment and management \nof critical risks and management’s risk mitigation strategies.

Given the importance of topics like information security to \nour business, which includes cybersecurity, the Board has determined that these matters should remain under the full \nBoard’s oversight. The AC supplements full Board oversight by reviewing and reporting on the adequacy and \neffectiveness of the Company’s information security policies and practices and the internal controls regarding \ninformation security risks. The AC receives quarterly information security updates from management, including our Chief \nSecurity Officer and members of our security team. The full Board also receives annual reports on information security \nmatters, including cybersecurity, from our Chief Security Officer and members of our security team.\nThe involvement of our Board committees is designed to increase the effectiveness of the Board's risk oversight by \nallocating authority and responsibility, as set forth in committee charters, to the particular committee that is best \nequipped to provide guidance and oversight regarding the operations, issues and risks presented, with escalation to the \nfull Board as appropriate. The AC also meets in executive session with the leaders of our key control functions, which \nensures that Board members have direct access to these teams, and that these teams are appropriately staffed and \nresourced. Committee chairpersons provide regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed by their \n30",
    "corporate governance policies of the board of directors": "committees, including key risks, and the committees work together with the full Board to facilitate the receipt of the \ninformation deemed necessary to fulfill their oversight responsibilities over our risk management activities.  Our Board \nbelieves that our Board leadership structure helps to facilitate its oversight of risk at the Company because its strong \nindependent Lead Director and independent committees proactively provide oversight of and engage with management \non the Company’s key risks. For further discussion, please see Board Leadership Structure  above.\nEach year management leads an ERM process, which includes a formal assessment of the Company’s risk environment.  \nThe ERM process is overseen and reviewed by the Board on an annual basis. Our ERM process identifies, assesses and \nmanages the Company’s most significant risks and uncertainties that could materially impact the long-term health of the \nCompany or prevent the achievement of strategic objectives.\nOur ERM team works with senior management to identify major risks to the Company.  The ERM process results are \nreviewed by our CEO, CFO, EVP of Worldwide Field Operations, EVP of Operations, General Counsel and internal audit \nteam. We do not have a member of senior management with the title of Chief Compliance Officer, as we believe it is more \neffective to have our senior management, who report directly to our CEO, responsible for managing key risks specific to \ntheir functional areas. Because risks are considered in conjunction with the Company’s operations and strategies, \nincluding long-term strategies, risks are identified and evaluated across different timeframes, including in the short-, \nintermediate- and long-term, depending on the specific risk. In evaluating top risks, the Board and management consider \nshort-, intermediate-, and long-term potential impacts on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of \noperations, which involves looking at the internal and external environment when evaluating risks, risk amplifiers and \nemerging trends, and they consider the risk horizon as part of prioritizing the Company’s risk mitigation efforts.  The \nCompany’s most significant risks identified through the ERM process are reviewed annually with the Board, including the \npotential impact and likelihood of the risks materializing over the relevant timeframe, future threats and trends, and the \nactions, strategies, processes, controls, and procedures used or to be implemented to manage and mitigate the risks. As \na part of this annual process the Board provides feedback on risk ranking and risk management strategies, as well as the \nERM process.\nThe Board and its committees receive updates, as appropriate, during the year from management regarding the risk \nmanagement processes, operations and organization, the mitigation of key existing and emerging risks and, as \nappropriate, provide feedback to address these matters, including those related to cybersecurity, trade compliance and \nstrategy. Management’s regular attendance at Board and committee meetings provides Board members direct access to \nour management team and the opportunity for the Board to receive updates on our risk exposure. Further, the agendas \nfor each Board meeting, as determined by our CEO and Lead Director, are developed and adjusted throughout the year, to \nadapt to any emerging risks or key topics.\nThe Company’s ERM process is structured to achieve robust and thoughtful Board-level attention on the Company’s risk \nmanagement process and the nature of the material risks faced by the Company.  It is also designed so that the Board \ncan respond to and mitigate these risks in a manner that closely aligns to the Company’s disclosure controls and \nprocedures.  The ERM results are reviewed and considered by members of management who are responsible for our \npublic reporting and the Board.  Our public reports are prepared by management who participate in the ERM process, and \nare reviewed by the Board or its committees, as appropriate, and this process contributes to the effective functioning of \nour disclosure controls and procedures.  Our risk oversight processes and disclosure controls and procedures are \ndesigned to appropriately identify potential risks for disclosure.\nThe Board, each of its committees, and senior management may, and have in the past, engaged outside advisors, experts \nand consultants, to help develop and analyze the Company’s risk management and mitigation efforts and associated \ncontrols and procedures, as well as to help the Company anticipate future threats and trends which could have an impact \non our business. The ERM process also facilitates the incorporation of risk assessment and evaluation into the strategic \nplanning process and the provision of regular reports to senior management, including the CEO, regarding the actions, \nstrategies, processes, controls, and procedures specific to managing, mitigating, and anticipating significant risks. \nCorporate Governance Policies of the Board of Directors\nThe Board has adopted Corporate Governance Policies to ensure that the Board has the necessary authority and \nprocesses in place to review and evaluate our business operations as needed and to make decisions that are independent \nof our management. These policies include practices the Board follows with respect to its composition and selection, \nregular evaluations of the Board and its committees, Board meetings and involvement of senior management, senior \nmanagement performance evaluation, and Board committees and compensation. These policies may be viewed under \nGovernance in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nvidia.com.\nExecutive Sessions of the Board\nAs required under Nasdaq’s listing standards, our independent directors meet regularly in scheduled executive sessions at \nwhich only independent directors are present, as well as in sessions with the CEO. In Fiscal 2023, our independent \ndirectors met in both types of executive sessions at three of our scheduled quarterly Board meetings.\n31",

A director shall be elected by the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast with \nrespect to that director, meaning the number of shares voted FOR  a director must exceed the number of votes cast \nAGAINST  that director. If the votes cast  FOR  an incumbent director in a non-contested election do not exceed the \nnumber of AGAINST  votes, such incumbent director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board. The NCGC or \nother committee that may be designated by the Board will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or \nreject the resignation or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on such committee’s recommendation \nand publicly disclose its decision and the rationale within 90 days from the date of certification of the election results. In \nmaking their decision, such committee and the Board will evaluate the best interests of the Company and its \nstockholders and shall consider all factors and information deemed relevant. The director who tenders his or her \nresignation will not participate in such committee’s recommendation or the Board’s decision.\nIn a contested election, in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, stockholders will \nbe given the choice to cast FOR  or WITHHOLD  votes for the election of directors and shall not have the ability to cast any \nother vote with respect to such election of directors.  Our directors will be elected by a plurality of the shares represented \nat any such meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of directors at that meeting.  The directors receiving \nthe greatest number of FOR  votes will be elected.\nIn either case, abstentions and broker non-votes will each be counted as present for purposes of determining the \npresence of a quorum but will have no effect on the vote.\nBoard Meeting Information\nThe Board met seven times during Fiscal 2023, including meetings during which the Board discussed the strategic \ndirection of NVIDIA, explored and discussed new business and strategic opportunities and the product roadmap, and \nother matters facing NVIDIA.  We expect each Board member to attend each meeting of the Board and the committees \non which he or she serves. Each Board member attended 75% or more of the meetings of the Board and of each \ncommittee on which he or she served during Fiscal 2023.\n33",
    "corporate responsibility": "Corporate Responsibility\nNVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. Our goal is to integrate sound \nCR principles and practices into every aspect of the Company. Our Board and management believe that environmental \nstewardship, social responsibility and solid governance are important to our business strategy and long-term value \ncreation. While the full Board has ultimate responsibility for CR matters that impact our business, each committee of the \nBoard oversees CR matters across our business operations in the areas that align with their respective responsibilities. \nThe NCGC is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our policies, issues and reporting related to CR, \nincluding overall CR strategy, risks and opportunities, and related programs and initiatives. The AC has primary \nresponsibility for overseeing our risk management program, and supplements the Board’s oversight of risks related to the \nadequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s information security policies and practices and the internal controls \nregarding information security risks. The CC is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our human \ncapital management practices, including diversity and inclusion matters. We assess our programs annually in \nconsideration of stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These issues are \nimportant for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders. \nThe following sections provide an overview of our principles and practices. More information can be found on the \nCorporate Responsibility section of our website and in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, or CR Report. \nInformation contained on our website or in our annual CR Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other \nreport we file with the SEC. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Form 10-K for a discussion of risks and uncertainties \nwe face related to CR.\nClimate Change\nIn the area of sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks, including \ncurrent and emerging regulations and market impacts. The NCGC oversees NVIDIA’s strategy for managing climate-\nrelated risks, opportunities and initiatives.\nIn our CR Report published in July 2022, we published metrics related to our environmental impact for Fiscal 2022.  Fiscal \n2023 metrics are expected to be published in the first half of Fiscal 2024. There has been no material impact to our \ncapital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with global sustainability regulations, \ncompliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of Fiscal 2025, our goal is to purchase or generate \nenough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and data centers.\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance \nsupercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPUs are \ninherently more energy efficient than other forms of computing because they are optimized for throughput, performance \nper watt and certain AI workloads. The energy efficiency of our products is evidenced by our continued strong presence \non the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 23 of the top 30 most energy efficient systems, \nincluding the top supercomputer, on the November 2022 Green500 list.\nWe plan to build Earth-2, a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Earth-2 will enable \nscientists, companies, and policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of climate change and \nexplore mitigation and adaptation strategies. \nHuman Capital Management\nThe CC is charged with oversight of human capital management, including with respect to employee diversity, equity and \ninclusion, talent acquisition, retention and development, employee engagement and corporate culture. In addition, the full \nBoard periodically discusses these topics. We believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role \nin creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of the end of Fiscal 2023, we had 26,196 employees in 35 countries, \n19,532 were engaged in research and development and 6,664 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and \nadministrative positions.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented \nemployees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\nRecruitment\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be competitive, we have grown our technical workforce and have \nbeen successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA. We have attracted strong talent globally with our differentiated hiring \nstrategies for university, professional, executive and diverse recruits. The COVID-19 pandemic created expanded hiring \nopportunities in new geographies and provided increased flexibility for employees to work from locations of their choice. \nApproximately 80% of our workforce is technical and approximately 50% of our workforce holds advanced degrees.\n34",
    "director compensation": "Director Compensation\nThe CC reviews our non-employee director compensation annually with the assistance of Exequity LLP, the CC’s \nindependent compensation consultant. Exequity LLP prepares a comprehensive assessment of our program, including \ncomparison to the executive compensation peer group most recently approved by the CC at the time of assessment, an \nupdate on recent trends in director compensation, and a review of related corporate governance best practices.  \nFor our non-employee director compensation program for the year starting on the date of our 2022 Meeting, or the 2022 \nProgram, the CC recommended, and the Board approved, maintaining the same compensation as the previous year — a \nmix of cash and equity awards with an approximate annual value of $340,000. This was slightly below the median total \nannual compensation paid by the peer group to their non-employee directors. We do not pay additional fees for serving as \na Lead Director, as chairperson or member of our AC, CC or NCGC (our three standard Board committees), or for meeting \nattendance. Directors who are also employees do not receive fees or equity compensation for service on the Board. \nCash Compensation \nThe cash portion of the annual retainer was $85,000, paid quarterly.  \nEquity Compensation\nThe target value of the equity portion of the annual retainer was $255,000, granted as RSUs on the first trading day \nfollowing the date of our 2022 Meeting, or the 2022 Program RSUs.  \nThe number of shares subject to each director’s 2022 Program RSUs equaled this value, divided by the 30-calendar day \ntrailing average closing price of our common stock ending the business day before the 2022 Meeting.  A trailing average \nwas used instead of a single stock price on the date of grant to reduce possible market volatility.  The CC understands \nthat using historical average stock prices can result in the ultimate grant date value of an award, as required to be \nreported in the Director Compensation Table under ASC 718, being different than the target equity value the CC intends \nto deliver. The CC considered various approaches to calculating the number of shares underlying the 2022 Program RSUs \nand determined the process described above is appropriate at this time.\nTo correlate the vesting of the 2022 Program RSUs to the directors’ service on the Board and its committees over the \nfollowing year, 50% of the RSUs vested on the third Wednesday in November 2022 and 50% will vest on the third \nWednesday in May 2023.  If a director’s service terminates due to death, their RSU grants will immediately vest in full for \nthe benefit of their beneficiaries.  Directors do not receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs.\nNon-employee directors can elect to defer settlement of RSUs upon vesting for tax planning purposes to the earlier of (i) \na future year (no sooner than 2024 for the 2022 Program RSUs) or (ii) in connection with the director’s cessation of \nservice or certain change in control events, in accordance with the rules under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue \nCode.  Messrs. Coxe and Jones, and Dr. Shah elected to defer settlement of their 2022 Program RSUs.\nOther Compensation/Benefits\nOur directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending Board and committee meetings and continuing \neducational programs pursuant to our Corporate Governance Policies. We do not offer change-in-control benefits to our \ndirectors, except for vesting acceleration under our equity plans that applies to all award holders under such plans if an \nacquirer does not assume or substitute for those awards.\n38",

    "pay versus performance": "Pay Versus Performance\nNVIDIA’s executive compensation program is guided by a pay for performance philosophy and is designed to align NEO \npay with our stockholders’ interests.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our NEOs’ total compensation is based on the \nCompany’s performance under certain corporate financial metric goals, including annual revenue, annual Non-GAAP \nOperating Income, and 3-year TSR relative to the S&P 500.  \nThe CC’s decisions on executive compensation for Fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 were made prior to the final, new SEC rules \nregarding pay versus performance, which requires disclosure of “compensation actually paid,” or CAP, for our NEOs. The \ndisclosure included in this section is prescribed by Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and does not \nnecessarily align with how the Company or the CC views the link between the Company’s performance and NEO pay.  In \nparticular, a mounts set forth below as CAP do not represent the value of compensation actually paid to or received by our \nNEOs.  Instead, CAP has been calculated in accordance with the new SEC rules, which include measurement of the \nchanges in the fair value of equity awards.  CAP is a supplemental measure to be viewed alongside, not in replacement of, \nperformance measures as an addition to the philosophy and strategy of compensation-setting discussed in greater detail \nabove in CD&A.\nRequired Tabular Disclosure of Pay Versus Performance\nThe following table summarizes information regarding compensation for our NEOs, including CAP as well as certain \nfinancial performance metrics during Fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021.

A lternatively, \nstockholders may abstain from casting a vote.\nAfter considering the benefits and consequences of each alternative, the Board recommends that the advisory vote on \nthe compensation of our NEOs be submitted to the stockholders every one year. In formulating its recommendation, the \nBoard considered that an annual advisory vote on executive compensation will allow stockholders to provide direct input \non the Company’s compensation philosophy, policies and practices every year.\nAccordingly, the Board is asking stockholders to indicate their preferred voting frequency by voting for one, two or three \nyears or abstaining from voting on the resolution below:\n“RESOLVED , that the alternative of soliciting advisory stockholder approval of the compensation of the Company’s \nexecutive officers once every one, two or three years that receives a majority of votes cast for this resolution will be \ndetermined to be the preferred frequency with which the Company is to hold a stockholder vote to approve the \ncompensation of the named executive officers.”\nBecause this proposal has four choices, it is possible that no choice will receive an affirmative vote of a majority of the \nshares present and entitled to vote on this matter.

Even if the selection is ratified, the AC in its \nsole discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time \nduring the fiscal year if it determines that such a change would be in our best interests and those of our stockholders. \nThe AC believes it is in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders to retain PwC.\nWe expect that a representative of PwC will attend the 2023 Meeting. The PwC representative will have an opportunity to \nmake a statement at the 2023 Meeting if he or she so desires and will also be available to respond to appropriate \nstockholder questions.\nRecommendation of the Board\nThe Board recommends that you vote FOR  the ratification of the selection of PwC as our independent registered \naccounting firm for our fiscal year ending January 28, 2024.\n67",

Our AC determined that the rendering of \nservices other than audit services by PwC was compatible with maintaining PwC’s independence.\nPre-Approval Policies and Procedures\nThe AC has adopted policies and procedures for the pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services rendered \nby our independent registered public accounting firm. The policy generally permits pre-approvals of specified permissible \nservices in the defined categories of audit services, audit-related services and tax services up to specified amounts. Pre-\napproval may also be given as part of the AC’s approval of the scope of the engagement of our independent registered \npublic accounting firm or on an individual case-by-case basis before the independent registered public accounting firm is \nengaged to provide each service. In some cases the full AC provides pre-approval for up to a year related to a particular \ndefined task or scope. In other cases, the AC has delegated power to the AC Chairperson to pre-approve additional audit \nand non-audit services if the need for the service was unanticipated and approval is required prior to the next scheduled \nmeeting of the AC. The AC Chairperson then communicates such pre-approval to the full AC at its next meeting. \n68",

The AC reviews the results and scope of the audit and other \nservices provided by the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews financial statements and the \naccounting policies followed by NVIDIA prior to the issuance of the financial statements with both management and the \nindependent registered public accounting firm.\nManagement is responsible for the financial reporting process, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in \naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, the system of internal control \nover financial reporting, and the procedures designed to facilitate compliance with accounting standards and applicable \nlaws and regulations. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or PwC, our independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal \n2023, was responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and issuing a report \non the consolidated financial statements and of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of \nJanuary 29, 2023.  PwC’s judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles and such \nother matters are required to be disclosed to the AC under applicable standards. The AC oversees these processes. Also, \nthe AC has ultimate authority and responsibility to select, evaluate and, when appropriate, terminate the independent \nregistered public accounting firm. The AC approves audit fees and non-audit services provided by and fees paid to the \nindependent registered public accounting firm.\nNVIDIA has an internal audit function that reports to the AC. This function is responsible for objectively reviewing and \nevaluating the adequacy, effectiveness and quality of our system of internal controls and the operating effectiveness of \nour business processes. The AC approves an annual internal audit plan and monitors the activities and performance of our \ninternal audit function throughout the year to ensure the plan objectives are carried out and met.\nThe AC members are not professional accountants or auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to \ncertify the activities of management or the independent registered public accounting firm. The AC does not plan or \nconduct audits, determine that our financial statements are complete and accurate and in accordance with GAAP or \nassess our internal control over financial reporting. The AC relies, without additional independent verification, on the \ninformation provided by our management and on the representations made by management that the financial \nstatements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity, and the opinion of PwC that such financial statements \nhave been prepared in conformity with GAAP.\nIn this context, the AC reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2023 with \nmanagement and our internal control over financial reporting with management and PwC. Specifically, the AC discussed \nwith PwC the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board and the SEC. We have received from PwC the written disclosures and letter required by the applicable \nrequirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC’s communications with the AC \nconcerning independence. The AC also considered whether the provision of certain permitted non-audit services by PwC \nis compatible with PwC’s independence and discussed PwC’s independence with PwC. \nBased on the AC’s review and discussions, the AC recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated \nfinancial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of NVIDIA for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023.\nAudit Committee\nMichael G.

    "director qualifications and nomination of directors": "Director Qualifications and Nomination of Directors\nThe NCGC identifies, reviews and assesses the qualifications of existing and potential directors and selects nominees for\nrecommendation to the Board for approval. They seek to ensure that the Board is composed of directors who exhibit a\nvariety of skills, education, professional experience and backgrounds, as well as bring diverse viewpoints and perspectives.\nThe NCGC may conduct any appropriate and necessary inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications of possible\ncandidates. The NCGC may also engage a professional search firm to identify and assist the NCGC in identifying, evaluating,\nand conducting due diligence on potential director nominees. The NCGC has not established specific age, gender, education,\nexperience, or skill requirements for potential members, and instead considers numerous factors regarding the nominee\nin light of our current and future business models, including the following: \n•Integrity and candor\n•Independence\n•Senior management and operational experience\n•Professional, technical and industry knowledge\n•Financial expertise\n•Financial community experience (including as an investor in\nother companies)\n•Marketing and brand management\n•Public company board experience\n•Experience with emerging technologies and new business\nmodels\n•Legal expertise•Diversity, including gender and ethnic background\n•Experience in academia\n•Willingness and ability to devote substantial time and effort to\nBoard responsibilities and Company oversight\n•Ability to represent the interests of the stockholders as a\nwhole rather than special interest groups or constituencies\n•All relationships between the proposed nominee and any of\nour stockholders, competitors, customers, suppliers or other\npersons with a relationship to NVIDIA\n•Overall service to NVIDIA, including past attendance at Board\nand committee meetings and participation and contributions to\nthe activities of the Board\nThe NCGC and the Board understand the importance of Board refreshment, and strive to maintain an appropriate balance\nof tenure, diversity, and skills on the Board.  While the Board benefits from the experience and institutional knowledge that\nour longer-serving directors bring, it has also brought in new perspectives and ideas by appointing three new directors in\nthe last four years, including, most recently in 2019, Mr. Neal, a veteran attorney and corporate advisor.  Our longer-tenured\ndirectors are familiar with our operations and business areas and have the perspective of overseeing our activities from a\nvariety of economic and competitive environments.  Our newer directors bring expertise in consumer marketing, branding,\ntechnology developments at leading academic institutions, and deep knowledge from decades of advising numerous\ncompanies that are important to supporting NVIDIA as it competes in new markets and as it faces new regulatory and legal\nchallenges.  Each year, the NCGC and Board review each director’s individual performance, including the director’s past\ncontributions, outside experiences and activities, and committee participation, and make a determination concerning how\nhis or her experience and skills continue to add value to NVIDIA and the Board.\nThe following chart summarizes the skills and competencies of each director nominee that led our Board to conclude that\nhe or she is qualified to serve on our Board. The lack of a check does not mean the director lacks that skill or qualification;\nrather, a check indicates a specific area of focus or expertise for which the Board relies on such director nominee most.\nSenior\nManagement\nand Operations\nprovides\nexperienced\noversight of our\nbusiness and\nwith new\ninsightsIndustry and\nTechnical\nfacilitates an\nunderstanding of\ninnovations and a\ntechnical\nassessment of our\nproducts and\nservicesFinancial/Financial\nCommunity\nassists with review of\nour operations and\nfinancial matters;\nthose with a venture\ncapital background\noffer shareholder\nperspectivesPublic\nCompany\nBoard\nhelps identify\nchallenges\nand risks we\nface as a\npublic\ncompanyEmerging\nTechnologies\nand Business\nModels\nintegral to our\ngrowth\nstrategies given\nour unique\nbusiness modelMarketing and\nBrand\nManagement\noffers guidance\non our\nproducts\ndirectly\nmarketed to\nconsumersLegal\nimportant as\nwe are subject\nto multiple\nlawsuits,\nregulatory\nmatters, and\nnew\nregulations\nBurgess ü ü üü\nCoxe ü üü\nDrell ü\nGaither ü ü ü\nHuang ü ü ü ü ü\nHudson ü ü ü ü\nJones ü ü ü üü\nMcCaffery ü ü ü\nNeal ü ü ü\nPerry ü ü ü ü\nSeawell ü ü üü\nStevens ü ü üü\n9",

All of our Board members as of the 2018 Meeting attended our 2018 Meeting.\nBoard Self-Assessments\nIn Fiscal 2019, the NCGC oversaw an evaluation process, conducted at least annually, whereby outside corporate counsel\nfor NVIDIA interviewed each director to obtain his or her evaluation of the Board as a whole, and of the committees on which\nhe or she serves. The interviews solicited ideas from the directors about, among other things, improving quality of Board\nand/or committee oversight effectiveness regarding strategic direction, financial and audit matters, executive compensation\nand other key matters.  The interviews also focused on Board process and identifying specific issues which should be\ndiscussed in the future.  After these evaluations were complete, our outside corporate counsel summarized the results,\nreviewed with our Lead Director, and then submitted the summary for discussion by the NCGC. \nIn response to the evaluations conducted in Fiscal 2019, director recruitment was prioritized and resulted in the appointment\nof Mr. Neal in March 2019.\nDirector Orientation and Continuing Education\nThe NCGC and our General Counsel are responsible for director orientation programs and for director continuing education\nprograms. Continuing education programs for directors may include a combination of internally developed materials and\npresentations, programs presented by third parties, and financial and administrative support for attendance at qualifying\nacademic or other independent programs. \nDirector Stock Ownership Guidelines\nThe Board believes that directors should hold a significant equity interest in NVIDIA. Our Corporate Governance Policies\nrequire each non-employee director to hold a number of shares of our common stock with a value equal to six times the\nannual cash retainer for Board service during the period in which he or she serves as a director (or six times the base\nsalary, in the case of the CEO).  The shares may include vested deferred stock, shares held in trust and shares held by\nimmediate family members. Non-employee directors have five years after their Board appointment to reach the ownership\nthreshold.  Our stock ownership guidelines are intended to further align director interests with stockholder interests.\nEach of our non-employee directors and Mr. Huang currently meets or exceeds the stock ownership requirements, with the\nexception of Mr. Neal, who joined our Board in March 2019.\nHedging and Pledging Policy\nOur directors and executive officers may not hedge their ownership of NVIDIA stock, including trading in options, puts, calls,\nor other derivative instruments related to NVIDIA stock or debt. Directors and executive officers may not purchase NVIDIA\nstock on margin, borrow against NVIDIA stock held in a margin account, or pledge NVIDIA stock as collateral for a loan.\n17",

    "director compensation": "Director Compensation\nThe CC reviews our non-employee director compensation program each year with the assistance of Exequity, who prepares\na comprehensive assessment of our program, including comparison to our Fiscal 2018 peer group used for executive\ncompensation purposes, an update on recent trends in director compensation, and a review of related corporate governance\nbest practices.  Following this review, the CC recommended no changes to our non-employee director compensation program\nfor the year starting on the date of our 2018 Meeting. \nThe CC subsequently recommended, and the Board approved, a mix of cash and equity awards with an approximate annual\nvalue of $300,000, which was slightly below the median total annual compensation paid by similarly-sized technology peer\ncompanies to their non-employee directors. We do not pay additional fees for serving as a chairperson or member of Board\ncommittees or for meeting attendance. Directors who are also employees do not receive fees or equity compensation for\nservice on the Board.  Discussion of Mr. Neal’s compensation is not included, as he was appointed to our Board in March\n2019.\nCash Compensation \nThe cash portion of the annual retainer, representing $75,000 on an annualized basis, was paid quarterly. \nEquity Compensation\nThe value of the equity award, in the form of RSUs, was $225,000.  The number of shares subject to each RSU award equaled\nthis value, divided by the average closing market price of our common stock over the 60 calendar days ending the business\nday before the 2018 Meeting.  The RSUs were granted on the first trading day following the date of our 2018 Meeting.\nTo correlate the vesting of the RSUs to the non-employee directors’ service on the Board and its committees over the\nfollowing year, the RSUs vested as to 50% on November 21, 2018 (the third Wednesday in November 2018) and will vest as\nto the remaining 50% on May 15, 2019 (the third Wednesday in May 2019).  If a non-employee director’s service terminates\ndue to death, his or her RSU grants will immediately vest in full for the benefit of his or her beneficiary.  Non-employee\ndirectors do not receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs.\nDeferral of Settlement\nNon-employee directors could elect to defer settlement of RSUs upon vesting, to be issued on the earliest of (a) the date of\nthe director’s “separation from service” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)), unless a six month\ndelay would be required under such Section, (b) the date of a change in control of NVIDIA that also would constitute a “change\nin control event” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)), and (c) the third Wednesday in March of the\nyear elected by the director, which year must have been no earlier than 2020.  Messrs. Gaither, Jones, and McCaffery, Dr.\nDrell, and Ms. Hudson elected to defer settlement of the RSUs granted to them in Fiscal 2019.\nOther Compensation/Benefits\nOur non-employee directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending Board and committee meetings and\ncontinuing educational programs pursuant to our Corporate Governance Policies. However, we do not offer change-in-\ncontrol benefits to our directors, except for the vesting acceleration provisions in our equity plans that apply to all holders\nof stock awards under such plans in the event that an acquirer does not assume or substitute for such awards.\n20",

In response to our stockholders’ preference,\nour Board has adopted a policy of providing for annual “say-on-pay” votes. This vote is not intended to address any specific\nitem of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices described\nin this proxy statement.\nThis advisory proposal is not binding on the Board or us. Nevertheless, the views expressed by the stockholders, whether\nthrough this vote or otherwise, are important to management and the Board and, accordingly, the Board and the CC intend\nto consider the results of this vote in making determinations in the future regarding NEO compensation arrangements.\nRecommendation of the Board\nThe Board recommends that our stockholders adopt the following resolution:\n“RESOLVED , that the compensation paid to the Company’s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of\nRegulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion is\nhereby  APPROVED .”\n.\n24",

    "risk analysis of our compensation plans": "Risk Analysis of Our Compensation Plans\nWith the oversight of the CC, members from the Company’s Legal, Human Resources and Finance departments, as well as\nExequity, the independent consultant engaged by the CC, performed an assessment of the Company’s compensation\nprograms and policies for Fiscal 2019 as generally applicable to our employees to ascertain any potential material risks\nthat may be created by our compensation programs.  The assessment focused on programs with variability of payout and\nthe ability of participants to directly affect payout and the controls over participant action and payout—specifically, the\nCompany’s variable cash compensation, equity compensation, and sales incentive compensation programs.  We identified\nthe key terms of these programs, potential concerns regarding risk taking behavior, and specific risk mitigation features.\nThe assessment was first presented to our Senior Vice President, Human Resources; our CFO; and our General Counsel,\nand then presented to the CC.\nThe CC considered the findings of the assessment described above and concluded that our compensation programs, which\nare structured to recognize both short-term and long-term contributions to the Company, do not create risks which are\nreasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.  The CC believes that the following\ncompensation design features guard against excessive risk-taking : \nCompensation Design Features that Guard Against Excessive Risk-Taking\nüOur compensation program encourages our employees to remain focused on both our short-term and long-term\ngoals\nüWe design our variable cash and PSU compensation programs for executives so that payouts are based on\nachievement of corporate performance targets, and we cap the potential award payout\nüWe have internal controls over our financial accounting and reporting which is used to measure and determine the\neligible compensation awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUs\nüFinancial plan target goals and final awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUs are approved by the CC\nand consistent with the annual operating plan approved by the full Board each year\nüMY PSUs are designed with a relative goal\nüWe have a compensation recovery policy applicable to all employees that allows NVIDIA to recover compensation\npaid in situations of fraud or material financial misconduct\nüAll executive officer equity awards have multi-year vesting\nüWe have stock ownership guidelines that we believe are reasonable and are designed to align our executive officers’\ninterests with those of our stockholders\nüWe enforce a “no-hedging” policy and a “no-pledging” policy involving our common stock which prevents our\nemployees from insulating themselves from the effects of NVIDIA stock price performance\n39",

The following text\nis marked to show the effects of the material changes to the Charter:\n“3. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors or any individual\ndirector may be removed from office at any time (i) with or without  cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of\na majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of voting stock of the Corporation, entitled to vote\nat an election of directors (the “Voting Stock”) or (ii) without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least\nsixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock .”\nPurpose of the 2019 A&R Charter and Effect of Stockholder Approval\nIn response to a shareholder’s concern about the validity of the 66 2/3% vote requirement to remove a director without\ncause, the Board and NCGC reviewed the Charter provision from a legal and policy perspective.  Our Board believes that\nthe current Charter provision complies with Delaware law.  Nonetheless, in light of evolving practices and stockholder input,\nour Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its investors to seek to amend the supermajority\ndirector removal provision. The elimination of the supermajority voting requirement would reinforce the Board's\naccountability to our stockholders, provide our stockholders with greater ability to participate in the corporate governance\nof NVIDIA, and demonstrate the Board's commitment to continued strong governance.  \nThe proposed amendments may, if adopted, make it easier for one or more stockholders to change the composition of our\nBoard and, therefore, make it more difficult for our Board to protect other stockholders’ interests.  Nevertheless, there are\nother actions that our Board can take to protect stockholders’ interests on such occasions.\nIf this Proposal 4 is approved by our stockholders, the 2019 A&R Charter will become effective upon its  filing with the\nDelaware Secretary of State.  Upon the filing of the 2019 A&R Charter with the Delaware Secretary of State, our Bylaws will\nalso be amended and restated, or the 2019 A&R Bylaws, to remove the 66 2/3% supermajority vote requirement.  In the\nevent that our stockholders do not approve this Proposal 4, the 2019 A&R Charter and the 2019 A&R Bylaws will not become\neffective and our Charter and Bylaws will continue in their current forms.\nRecommendation of the Board\nThe Board has declared the 2019 A&R Charter to be advisable and has directed that the amendment and restatement be\nsubmitted to NVIDIA’s stockholders for approval at the 2019 Meeting.  The Board recommends that our stockholders adopt\nthe following resolution:\n“RESOLVED , that NVIDIA’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, including the following revisions:\n•amendment of Article V(A)(3) to remove the 66 2/3% supermajority vote requirement for removal of\ndirectors without cause, thereby providing for majority voting; and\n•such non-substantive revisions as determined by management to be in the best interests of the Company\nand its stockholders;\nis hereby APPROVED. ”\n50",

    "director qualifications and nomination of directors": "Director Qualifications and Nomination of Directors\nThe NCGC identifies, reviews and assesses the qualifications of existing and potential directors and selects nominees for \nrecommendation to the Board for approval.  In accordance with our Corporate Governance Policies and the NCGC Charter, \nthe NCGC is committed to Board diversity and shall consider a nominee’s background and experience to ensure that a \nbroad range of perspectives is represented on the Board.  The NCGC may conduct appropriate and necessary inquiries \ninto the backgrounds and qualifications of possible candidates and may engage a professional search firm to identify and \nassist the committee in identifying, evaluating, and conducting due diligence on potential director nominees.  The NCGC \nhas not established specific age, gender, education, experience, or skill requirements for potential members, and instead \nconsiders numerous factors regarding the nominee, taking into account our current and future business models, \nincluding the following: \n•Integrity and candor\n•Independence\n•Senior leadership and operational experience\n•Professional, technical and industry knowledge\n•Financial expertise\n•Financial community experience (including as an investor in \nother companies)\n•Marketing, communications and brand management \nbackground\n•Governance and public company board experience\n•Experience with emerging technologies and new business \nmodels\n•Regulatory, legal, and risk management expertise, including in \ncybersecurity matters•Diversity, including race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, or \nmembership in another underrepresented community\n•Human capital management experience\n•Experience in academia\n•Willingness and ability to devote substantial time and effort to \nBoard responsibilities and Company oversight\n•Ability to represent the interests of the stockholders as a whole \nrather than special interest groups or constituencies\n•All relationships between the proposed nominee and any of our \nstockholders, competitors, customers, suppliers, or other \npersons with a relationship to NVIDIA\n•For nominees for re-election, overall service to NVIDIA, including \npast attendance, participation and contributions to the \nactivities of the Board and its committees\nThe NCGC and the Board understand the importance of Board refreshment, and strive to maintain an appropriate balance \nof tenure, diversity, professional experience and backgrounds, skills, and education on the Board.  While the Board \nbenefits from the experience and institutional knowledge that our longer-serving directors bring, it has also brought in \nnew perspectives and ideas through the appointment of three new directors since 2020.  The Board also regularly rotates \ncommittee membership and chairpersons to help promote a diversity of viewpoints on the Board committees.  Our \nlonger-tenured directors are familiar with our operations and business areas and have the perspective of overseeing our \nactivities from a variety of economic and competitive environments, which enhances the Board’s oversight of strategy \nand risks.  Given the growth of the Company and the breadth of our product offerings, as well as the increasingly complex \nmacroeconomic and geopolitical factors we face, these experienced directors are a significant asset to the Board.  Our \nnewer directors have brought expertise in brand development and cybersecurity, familiarity with technology \ndevelopments at leading academic institutions, and senior management and operating experience as well as finance \nexperience, all of which are important to supporting NVIDIA as it enters new markets.  Each year, the NCGC and Board \nreview each director’s individual performance, including the director’s past contributions, outside experiences and \nactivities, and committee participation, and determine how his or her experience and skills continue to add value to \nNVIDIA and the Board.\nThe Board and the NCGC continue to seek highly qualified women and individuals from underrepresented groups to \ninclude in the initial pool of director candidates.  The Board’s commitment to achieving a diverse and inclusive \nmembership is demonstrated by our director nominees.  Four of our directors are women and three of our directors are \nethnically and/or racially diverse. Our three newest members enhance the Board’s gender, ethnic, and/or racial diversity. \n16",

The amount that NVIDIA paid in each of the last three fiscal years to \nStanford University, and the amount received in each fiscal year by NVIDIA from Stanford University, did not, in any of the \nprevious three fiscal years, exceed the greater of $200,000 or 1% of either entity’s consolidated gross revenues.\nAfter considering the above arrangements, and all other relevant relationships and transactions, our Board determined \nthat, except for Mr. Huang, all of our directors are “independent” as defined by Nasdaq’s rules and regulations.

Our ERM process identifies, assesses, \nand manages the Company’s most significant risks and uncertainties that could materially impact the long-term health of \nthe Company or prevent the achievement of strategic objectives. \nOur ERM team works with senior management, as well as our Lead Director and committee chairpersons, to identify \nmajor risks to the Company.  We do not have a member of senior management with the title of Chief Compliance Officer.  \nInstead, our ERM process and action plan are reviewed by our CEO and other NEOs who report directly to our CEO, other \nmembers of senior management, and our internal audit team. This full team of leaders is responsible for managing key \nrisks specific to their functional areas. \nThe ERM process facilitates the incorporation of risk assessment and evaluation into the strategic planning process. \nBecause risks are considered in conjunction with the Company’s operations and strategies, including long-term \nstrategies, risks are identified and evaluated across different timeframes, including in the short-, intermediate-, and long-\nterm, depending on the specific risk.  In evaluating top risks, the Board and management consider short-, intermediate-, \nand long-term potential impacts on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, which involves \nlooking at the internal and external environment when evaluating risks, risk amplifiers, and emerging trends, and they \nconsider the risk horizon as part of prioritizing the Company’s risk mitigation efforts.  The Company’s significant risks \nidentified through the ERM process are reviewed periodically, but at least annually with the Board and AC, including the \npotential impact and likelihood of the risks materializing over the relevant timeframe, future threats and trends, and the \nactions, strategies, processes, controls, and procedures used or to be implemented to manage and mitigate the risks.  As \na part of this annual process, the Board provides feedback on risk management strategies, as well as the ERM process.  \nThe Board and its committees receive updates, as appropriate, during the year from management regarding the risk \nmanagement processes, operations and organization, the mitigation of key existing and emerging risks and, as \nappropriate, provide feedback to address these matters, including those related to cybersecurity, trade compliance, and \nstrategy.  Management’s regular attendance at Board and committee meetings provides Board members direct access to \nour management team and the opportunity for the Board to receive updates on our risk exposure.  Further, the agendas \nfor each Board meeting, as determined by our CEO and Lead Director, are developed and adjusted throughout the year, to \nadapt to any emerging risks or key topics.\nThe Company’s ERM process is designed so that the Board can respond to risks in a manner that closely aligns to the \nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures.  The ERM results are reviewed and considered by members of \nmanagement who are responsible for our public reporting and the Board.  Our public reports are prepared by \nmanagement who participate in the ERM process, and are reviewed by the Board or its committees, as appropriate, and \nthis process contributes to the effective functioning of our disclosure controls and procedures.  Our risk oversight \nprocesses and disclosure controls and procedures are designed to appropriately identify potential risks for disclosure. \nThe Board, each of its committees, and senior management have in the past and may continue to engage outside \nadvisors, experts, and consultants, to help develop and analyze the Company’s risk management and mitigation efforts \nand associated controls and procedures, as well as to help the Company anticipate future threats and trends which could \nhave an impact on our business.\nCorporate Governance Policies of the Board of Directors\nThe Board has adopted Corporate Governance Policies to ensure that the Board has the necessary authority and \nprocesses in place to review and evaluate our business operations as needed and to make decisions that are independent \nof our management.  These policies include practices the Board follows with respect to its composition and selection, \nregular evaluations of the Board and its committees, Board meetings and involvement of senior management, senior \nmanagement performance evaluation, and Board committees and compensation.  These policies may be viewed under \nGovernance in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nvidia.com.\nExecutive Sessions of the Board\nAs required under Nasdaq’s listing standards, our independent directors meet regularly in scheduled executive sessions at \nwhich only independent directors are present, as well as in sessions with the CEO. In Fiscal 2024, our independent \ndirectors met in both types of executive sessions at four of our scheduled quarterly Board meetings.\n30",

Our \nCS team updates the NCGC at least semiannually on these topics, as well as pertinent regulations and stakeholder inputs, \nand gathers feedback from the NCGC on issues such as climate change, human rights, and diversity and inclusion. The CS \nteam also reports on sustainability issues to the full Board annually.\nIn Fiscal 2024, we launched a Corporate Sustainability Steering Committee, or the CSSC, comprised of members of our \nexecutive leadership team.

Our own employees help to surface top talent, with over 40% of our new hires in \nFiscal 2024 coming from employee referrals.\nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted \ndevelopment programs, mentoring and peer coaching and ongoing feedback.  We offer tuition reimbursement programs \nto subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications.  We implemented a career coaching service to provide \none-on-one guidance to employees, and encourage internal job mobility.  We have implemented specifically designed \nmentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure \nwidespread readiness for future advancement.\nWe want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime.

The assessment focused on programs with variability of payout and the \nability of participants to directly affect payout and the controls over participant action and payout—specifically, the \nCompany’s variable cash compensation, equity compensation, and sales incentive compensation programs.  We identified \nthe key terms of these programs, potential risks they may present, and specific risk mitigation features.\nThe CC considered the findings of the assessment described above and concluded that our compensation programs, \nwhich are structured to recognize both short-term and long-term contributions to the Company, do not create risks \nwhich are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.  \nThe CC believes that the following compensation design features mitigate against risk : \nüOur compensation program encourages our employees to remain focused on both our short-term and long-\nterm goals, and balances incentives by using a mix of base salary and variable pay\nüWe design our variable cash and PSU compensation programs for executives so that payouts are based on \nachievement of corporate performance targets, and we cap the potential award payout\nüWe have internal controls over our financial accounting and reporting which are used to measure and \ndetermine the eligible compensation awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUs\nüFinancial plan target goals and final awards under our Variable Cash Plan, SY PSUs, and Additional SY PSUs are \napproved by the CC and informed by the annual financial plan approved by the Board each year\nü MY PSUs are designed with a relative goal\nüWe have a compensation recovery policy applicable to executive officers that requires NVIDIA to recover \ncertain incentive compensation paid in connection with certain accounting restatements\nü The CC monitors burn rate and overhang\nü All executive officer equity awards have multi-year vesting\nüWe have stock ownership guidelines that we believe are reasonable and are designed to align our executive \nofficers’ interests with those of our stockholders\nüOur insider trading policy prohibits hedging, pledging, using margin accounts, and trading in derivatives \ninvolving our common stock which prevents our employees from insulating themselves from the effects of \nNVIDIA stock price performance\n55",

Compensation paid in foreign \ncurrencies was converted to U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect on January 28, 2024.  \n60",
    "pay versus performance": "After applying the methodology described above, we determined the identity of our median employee for Fiscal 2024, \nwhose Fiscal 2024 total compensation was $266,939.  Our CEO’s Fiscal 2024 total compensation was $34,167,902.  \nTherefore, our Fiscal 2024 CEO to median employee pay ratio was 128:1.\nThis pay ratio represents a reasonable estimate of the relationship between the compensation of our CEO and that of our \nmedian employee for Fiscal 2024, calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K and applicable \nguidance, which provide significant flexibility in how companies identify the median employee.  Each company may use a \ndifferent methodology, apply different exclusions, and make different assumptions.  As a result, the pay ratio reported by \nother companies may not be comparable to ours. \nPay Versus Performance\nNVIDIA’s executive compensation program is guided by a pay for performance philosophy and is designed to align NEO \npay with our stockholders’ interests.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our NEOs’ total compensation is based on the \nCompany’s performance under certain corporate financial metric goals, which for Fiscal 2024 included annual revenue, \nannual Non-GAAP Operating Income, annual Non-GAAP Gross Margin, and 3-year TSR relative to the S&P 500.  \nAmounts set forth below as “compensation actually paid,” or CAP, have been calculated in accordance with Item 402(v) of \nRegulation S-K under the Securities Act, and do not represent the value of compensation actually paid to or received by \nour NEOs.  For a discussion of our executive compensation program and philosophy, refer to our CD&A above.\nThe following table summarizes information regarding compensation for our NEOs, including CAP as well as certain \nfinancial performance metrics, during Fiscal 2024, 2023, 2022, and 2021.

The AC reviews the results and scope of the audit and other \nservices provided by the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews financial statements and the \naccounting policies followed by NVIDIA prior to the issuance of the financial statements with both management and the \nindependent registered public accounting firm.\nManagement is responsible for the financial reporting process, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in \naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, the system of internal control \nover financial reporting, and the procedures designed to facilitate compliance with accounting standards and applicable \nlaws and regulations.

The AC relies, without additional independent verification, on the \ninformation provided by our management and on the representations made by management that the financial \nstatements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity, and the opinion of PwC that such financial statements \nhave been prepared in conformity with GAAP.\nIn this context, the AC reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2024 with \nmanagement and our internal control over financial reporting with management and PwC.  Specifically, the AC discussed \nwith PwC the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board and the SEC.  We have received from PwC the written disclosures and letter required by the applicable \nrequirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC’s communications with the AC \nconcerning independence.
